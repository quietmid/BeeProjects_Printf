# BeeProjects_Printf
Here is my attempt at recreating the printf function from C. 

This function should successfully mimic the library printf function and convert %c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X and %%(print the percent sign).

The extrenal functions that we are allowed to use in this project are malloc, free, write, va_start, va_arg, va_copy, and va_end.
